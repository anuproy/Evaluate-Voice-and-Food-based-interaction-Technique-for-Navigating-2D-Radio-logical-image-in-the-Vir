# Evaluate-Voice-and-Food-based-interaction-Technique-for-Navigating-2D-Radio-logical-image-in-the-Virtual-Reality(VR)-in-Unity 
Our ambition is to create a virtual environment that feels realistic OT, where they can move freely and walk around the spare. For the pose of the user (sitting, walking and standing) control the images with trigger function applied by foot or voice command. We got to know while discussing OT environment with the surgeon's none of them could enter the restricted area on surgery period without a surgeon. Considering the light view of the patient, the user can move the surgical lamps, image view monitor. In this environment, the most common types of equipment and surgical tools have been introduced as well as an artificial patient -A, along with X-ray machine -B, anesthesia -C, surgical lamp -D, surgery tools â€“E (scissors, forceps, scalpel, knife). Practically the environment has been designed according to the surgeon's point of view, users see the way they want to look.
