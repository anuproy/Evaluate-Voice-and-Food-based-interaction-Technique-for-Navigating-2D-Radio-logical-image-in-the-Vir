# Experimental Design
**Problem statement and motivation** 

The usual way of interacting with the radiology images in OT(Operation Theatre) is either via mouse or keyboard. Due to sterility surgeons need an assistant to show them the exact images. However, communication with the substitute might be complicated, if the operator and surgeon do not have an equal level of professional skill, which consume time and might interrupt the workflow. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to provide a comfortable, precise and sterile interaction technique to enable surgeon to interact with computing devices independently. Create a virtual environment that feels realistic OT, where they can move freely and walk around the spare. For the pose of the user (sitting, walking and standing) control the images with trigger function applied by foot or voice command. Our aim is to develop a system where a surgeon can access valuable information seamlessly without touching monitor or without any help of assistant. During surgery the foot, and voice of the surgeon is considered as non-sterile. This area can be considered to design an interactive device to extract information from computer. 

We have designed a Virtual Reality Operation Theatre in perspective of Bangladesh. In  this environment, innovative interaction tools can be preliminary evaluated to determine how much usable and efficient the tools for real operation theater, without incorporating new tools into the real operation theatre. 

Considering the light view of the patient, the user can move the surgical lamps, image view monitor. In this environment, the most common types of equipment and surgical tools have been introduced as well as

* artificial patient -A,
* X-ray machine -B, 
* anesthesia -C,
* surgical lamp -D,
* surgery tools –E (scissors, forceps, scalpel, knife).
Practically the environment has been designed according to the surgeon's point of view, users see the way they want to look.

## Task Script
***You are going to perform two tasks using two different methods.***

A dummy box consists of different material of balls, is placed on top of the table and its surrounding is covered with piece of green clothes as shown in Figure 1.
A set of 2D CT scan images will be display in the VR environment, screenshot of 2D image shown in Figure 2.

### Method 1(Interactive-shoe):
Task:  You will stand/sit in front of the table wearing Interactive-shoe. Your task is to fetch the small ball which is hidden in one of the big balls from the stack of 2D CT scan images. For this, please see all or few of the 2D CT scan images in the computer screen by scrolling up or down to detect the hidden small ball.
To activate the scrolling command: press the push-button side of the interactive-shoe
For scrolling up: drag your foot forward
For scrolling down: drag your foot backward
To freeze the screen: press the push-button side of the interactive-shoe

You will repeat the same task three times with different set of CT scan images.
Method 2(voice command):
Task:  You will stand/sit in front of the table. Your task is to fetch the small ball which is hidden in one of the big balls from the stack of 2D CT scan images using voice command. For this, please see all or few of the 2D CT scan images in the computer screen by scrolling up or down to detect the hidden small ball.
For scrolling up:  please say “UP/ FORWARD” 
For scroll down: please say “DOWN/ BACKWARD”

You will repeat the same task three times with different set of CT scan images.

After the completion of each task you suppose to attend post-test and post-task questionnaire
