# Experimental Design
## Problem statement and motivation

The usual way of interacting with the radiology images in OT(Operation Theatre) is either via mouse or keyboard. Due to sterility surgeons need an assistant to show them the exact images. However, communication with the substitute might be complicated, if the operator and surgeon do not have an equal level of professional skill, which consume time and might interrupt the workflow. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to provide a comfortable, precise and sterile interaction technique to enable surgeon to interact with computing devices independently. Create a virtual environment that feels realistic OT, where they can move freely and walk around the spare. For the pose of the user (sitting, walking and standing) control the images with trigger function applied by foot or voice command. Our aim is to develop a system where a surgeon can access valuable information seamlessly without touching monitor or without any help of assistant. During surgery the foot, and voice of the surgeon is considered as non-sterile. This area can be considered to design an interactive device to extract information from computer. 

We have designed a Virtual Reality Operation Theatre in perspective of Bangladesh. In  this environment, innovative interaction tools can be preliminary evaluated to determine how much usable and efficient the tools for real operation theater, without incorporating new tools into the real operation theatre. 

Considering the light view of the patient, the user can move the surgical lamps, image view monitor. In this environment, the most common types of equipment and surgical tools have been introduced as well as 
* artificial patient -A,
* X-ray machine -B, 
* anesthesia -C,
* surgical lamp -D,
* surgery tools â€“E (scissors, forceps, scalpel, knife).
Practically the environment has been designed according to the surgeon's point of view, users see the way they want to look.
